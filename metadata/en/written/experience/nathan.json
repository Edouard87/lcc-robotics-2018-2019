  "text": "This year, the programming team was challenged with creating a system to quickly and accurately sort different colored balls into separate containers. We learned a lot about how to wire different electronics on a “prototype board” to create sensors that are usable with the VEX Cortex. I really enjoyed learning about the different methods of wiring electronics and being able to interface hardware and software. We really struggled to get our light sensor working correctly and when it started working correctly for the first time, it felt like a huge win. Overall, I have enjoyed my experience in the CRC thus far, and I am looking forward to the competition."}
