  "text": "This year at robotics, I worked on the programming team at robotics. The programming team was challenged with working on a high speed ball sorter system which sorts balls by colour. We also needed to program our robot so that it would work with Mechanum Wheels, which are a bit more challenging to program rather than normal wheels. It was also challenging to work more with wires and hardware in general, as well as fixing the prototype multiple times. It was really fun to program this year, as I gained experience not only in programming, but also in hardware work, which was really fun. I’m really excited for the CRC Competition and I’m sure the rest of the team is excited as well."}
