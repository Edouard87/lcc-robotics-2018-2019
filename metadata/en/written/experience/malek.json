  "text": "This was my first year in robotics, I worked on the movie and the sorter and it was one of the best experiences in my life. It was challenging, fun. Judging from the other years robots I think that we have a good chance of doing well in the competition. I saw much progress since the beginning and now. This was one of my best experiences ever."}
