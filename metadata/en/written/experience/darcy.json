  "text": "During the preparation and the building of the robot for the 2019 CRC Vertigoal Competition, the team encountered several problems along the way such as the design for the sorter, the problems we encountered with the LED lights we used for the sorter. Because of the LEDs, this led us to have been set back a bit on the electronics but fortunately, it wasn’t much of a setback. For the film (which I am in charge of), a setback would be the testing for different microphones. For example, we tried to use a clip-on mic but it was too close to the speaker’s mouth so the clip was too loud and when the audio was lowered, the audio was choppy. I would say that the sacrifices that were made for the team would be time. The robotics team has spent so much time and effort on designing and building the robot, website, kiosk and also the film but I would say that overall it was worth it since I (and hopefully many other people) learned a lot about teamwork and about engineering and also had a fun time working on this robot."}
