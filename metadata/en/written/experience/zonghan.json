  "text": "This is my first year doing robotics at LCC. It was challenging and confusing. However, with the help of others and my enthusiasm, we start of with nothing but materials, to a functional robot. I'm very proud of myself and the others that helped me. I also learned a lot of techniques and other stuff such as using machines during this wonderful experience. I really had a lots of fun and I made a lot of friends."}
