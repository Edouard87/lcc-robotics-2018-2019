  "text": "My first year ever doing robotics was great! At first I was a bit nervous because I never really done robotics before and I didnâ€™t know what to do. But eventually I made some friends who helped me along the way. I also learned a lot about how to build a robot, its different parts and how to use machines. Whenever I go to robotics, I am always excited to learn something new and participate in the activities. Overall, I think that robotics is a fun activity that everyone should try out."}
