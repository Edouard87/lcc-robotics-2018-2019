  "text": "Given that the tennis balls are 2.7 inches and the steps are 3 inches any part of the pickup either has to be within the wheels diameter or be retractable. If the pickup system canâ€™t do that it prevents the robot from climbing the step. Our pickup mechanism consists of a wheel that pinches balls rolling them up a ramp and into the robot. Once in the robot the ride up a conveyor belt along a wall ending up at the sorter. The system is 6 balls wide allowing many balls to pass through it at once. To be able to climb the step the system had to be built in between the wheels and the ramp can pivot out of the way if necessary."}
