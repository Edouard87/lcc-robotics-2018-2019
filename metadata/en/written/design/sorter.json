  "text": "To have a competitive robot it must be one that is capable of sorting. Without sorting your chances of scoring are no better than a 50/50. Our sorter relies on colour to determine which balls to keep and which to throw out. If a good ball is detected it passes through the sorter without any issue. If however, the ball is not the colour it should be a gate forces the ball off to the side where it can be discarded. The sorter was one of the more time consuming builds for the robot. Creating an environment where ball colour could be determined consistently in various light conditions was harder than expected. Currently we have a functioning sorter and are building the final version which will be installed on the robot. "}
