  "text": "Initially we had looked at using an air cannon to throw our balls. Sadly we could not deliver enough power to get the balls to the height needed and decided to focus our efforts elsewhere. The current design uses two 6 inch drums made from wheels and a Sono tube around the Sono tube we wrapped some skateboard deck tape to increase the friction between the rollers and the balls. Each roller attached to a banebot running at 3000 rpm can consistently score 3 pointers on a basketball court and can deliver up to 180 balls per second."}
