  "text": "The drive system had to accomplish one unique task in comparison to a standard robot. Having to climb steps gave us the choice of using large wheels or some others system. The first option is simple, with large wheels we could simply roll over the step and we wouldn't need to worry about the levels on the playing field. Instead we chose a different method. By using mecanum wheels for our base we can travel in any direction or turn in place. The disadvantage to these wheels is they are rather small at have trouble climbing steps. We purchased 8 inch wheels, the biggest we could buy at a reasonable price, and removed one of the individuals rollers to create a gap in the wheels. This gap allows the robot to hook the step and pull itself up the playing field. This means that aside from moving in any direction we can also climb all while remaining close to the ground increasing the amount of room for the rest of our robot. "}
